##nb-CG-ZIF-FF: Non-Bonded Reactive Coarse-Grained Force Field for ZIF-8

## Overview
This repository contains the tabulated non-bonded interaction potentials for nb-CG-ZIF-FF,
a reactive coarse-grained (CG) force field developed for the  zeolitic-imidazolate
framework ZIF-8, designed to study its self-assembly mechanism.

## File Format
Each data file is a plain-text, two-column table:

| Column | Quantity | Unit |
|--------|----------|------|
| 1      | Interatomic distance (r) | Å (Angstrom) |
| 2      | Force                    | kcal/mol·nm |

- Columns are separated by whitespace
